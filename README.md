## Overview

The lid-driven cavity problem is a standard CFD benchmark for incompressible, unsteady flow. This script uses the SIMPLE algorithm (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations) on a staggered grid, with explicit iteration for educational clarity.

## Key Features

- Finite Volume discretization on staggered grid
- Explicit (triple-nested) loops for clarity
- Real-time animated visualization of:
  - Velocity vectors
  - Velocity magnitude contours
  - Pressure contours
  - Streamlines
  - Residuals
- GIF output for each visualization
- Benchmarking: reports elapsed simulation time

## Setup and Usage

1. Open MATLAB (R2020a or newer recommended).
2. Open `IterativeSolver.m` in the `Matlab` folder.
3. Adjust simulation parameters at the top of the script as needed:
   ```matlab
   Re = 100;         % Reynolds number
   n = 151;          % Grid size (n x n)
   dt = 0.0005;      % Time step
   total_time = 2;   % Total simulation time (seconds)
