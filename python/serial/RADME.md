## Introduction

This folder contains **serial (single-core) Python implementations** of the SIMPLE algorithm for the lid-driven cavity CFD benchmark.  
The solvers here were originally developed in their own branches (`iterative` and `vectorized`) and are now organized under a single `serial` branch for easier access and comparison.

The **iterative** solver uses explicit Python loops for clarity, while the **vectorized** solver uses NumPy array operations for higher performance.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Iterative (loop-based)** solver for educational clarity
- ‚úÖ **Vectorized (NumPy)** solver for speed
- üìä Built-in visualization of velocity, pressure, and residual convergence
- üß† Modular code structure with clear functions for each SIMPLE step
- üîÑ Easy parameter tuning (Reynolds number, grid size, time step)
- üìù Inline documentation

## How to Run

1. **Install requirements** (in a virtual environment is recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

2. **Run the iterative solver**:
    ```bash
    cd iterative
    python IterativeSolver.py
    ```

3. **Run the vectorized solver**:
    ```bash
    cd ../vectorized
    python VectorizedSolver.py
    ```

4. **Adjust parameters**:  
   At the top of each script, you can change:
   ```python
   Re = 100
   n = 51
   dt = 0.002
   total_time = 1.0
   record_gif = True
   ```

## View Results

After running a solver, the program will:
- Display velocity vector plots
- Display pressure contours
- Show residual convergence plots in real-time

If `record_gif = True`:
- GIF animations of the simulation will be saved in the current working directory.
- GIFs will include velocity vectors, velocity magnitude contours, pressure fields, streamlines, and residual plots.

## Benchmark Note

- ‚ö° The vectorized solver is typically **5‚Äì20√ó faster** than the loop-based version on large grids.
- Both solvers produce identical results ‚Äî the vectorized version simply runs faster by leveraging optimized NumPy array operations.
- Use the iterative solver if you want to understand the algorithm step-by-step, or the vectorized solver for larger simulations and faster runtimes.
