## Introduction

The lid-driven cavity problem is a classical benchmark in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for validating incompressible flow solvers. This directory provides reference MATLAB implementations using the SIMPLE algorithm, ideal for learning, rapid prototyping, and establishing baseline results.

---

## Why MATLAB?

MATLAB is a powerful environment for CFD solver development due to:
- **Rapid prototyping** — Matrix operations and built-in visualization tools
- **Clarity** — Clean syntax for learning and debugging
- **Visualization** — Immediate feedback with plotting capabilities
- **Reference foundation** — Validates algorithm correctness before porting to other languages

---

## Features

- ✅ Loop-based and vectorized SIMPLE solvers
- 📊 Built-in visualization of velocity and pressure fields
- 🧠 Clear structure for educational use and prototyping
- 🔄 Easy parameter tuning for Reynolds number, grid size, and time steps

## Available Solvers

| File                                         | Description                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [IterativeSolver.m](IterativeSolver.m)        | Classic SIMPLE algorithm (explicit iteration)    |
| [VectorizedSolver.m](VectorizedSolver.m)      | Fully vectorized MATLAB implementation for speed |

Each solver script includes inline documentation and usage instructions.

---

## How to Run

1. Open MATLAB (R2020a or newer recommended)
2. Open either `IterativeSolver.m` or `VectorizedSolver.m`
3. Run the script
4. Adjust simulation parameters at the top of the file
5. View velocity and pressure plots generated automatically

## Benchmark Note

- **Performance:** The vectorized solver is typically **10x faster** than the loop-based version on larger grids, thanks to MATLAB’s optimized matrix operations.
- Both solvers produce identical results, allowing direct speed and accuracy comparisons.
